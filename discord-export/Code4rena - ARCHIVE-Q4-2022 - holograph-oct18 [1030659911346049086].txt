What's the improved c4udit? Also is there a link to a repo so I can make sure my checks don't overlap?


[10/19/2022 10:33] thepicodes
It's a version of C4udit I've made accessible here: https://github.com/Picodes/code4rena-report-generator. You're welcome to contribute 🙂


[10/19/2022 10:34] thepicodes
But actually it has not been endorsed by C4, it took the initiative to run it


[10/19/2022 10:34] thepicodes
Main difference being that it's in typescript and should be more flexible than C4udit

[10/21/2022 10:07] acc01ade
We don’t use a standard license. So the code is marked as UNLICENSED and a custom license is included in text.


[10/21/2022 11:32] zhyd1997
Maybe `// SPDX-License-Identifier: SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE` is better 👀


[10/21/2022 14:48] acc01ade
That's already done in `package.json` file https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/package.json#L5
Can't really do that in smart contracts since they don't reference repo and have source code immediately viewable on block explorers like Etherscan.
Makes more sense to just label as "UNLICENSED" and attach license text at top of each file.

what is "beam" ?


[10/22/2022 15:32] thirdmanjack
Beam is our term for the activity of holographic bridging. Since our process is different than a typical bridge, “beam” is more appropriate. Hope this helps!


[10/22/2022 15:48] trust90
All the different operator nodes running the CLI will use the same trusted operator address for on-chain calls?


[10/22/2022 17:56] acc01ade
Could you clarify the question? Are you referring to if they call the same on-chain smart contract address to execute the job, or if they all use the same private key / wallet to send the transaction to the chain?


[10/22/2022 18:02] trust90
Yeah I was asking about the second option but looking through HolographOperator answered it


[10/22/2022 18:03] trust90
Still, a description of the trust model of operators and how their work is verified to be honest would be welcome.


[10/22/2022 18:50] alexander9001
If operators fail to execute jobs they are selected for their bond is slashed


[10/22/2022 18:50] alexander9001
And the job will be reassigned to a new operator


[10/22/2022 18:52] alexander9001
Jobs contain the full call data to complete the transaction on the destination chain

[10/24/2022 01:04] ladboy233
what kind of contract can be deployed cross-chain?


[10/24/2022 01:04] ladboy233
it is only HolographERC721. HolographERC20


[10/24/2022 01:04] ladboy233
?


[10/24/2022 01:04] ladboy233
what is a "holographable smart contract"


[10/24/2022 01:23] ladboy233
Or may I ask what makes a smart contract holographable?


[10/24/2022 02:08] 100proof
@0xladboy | Sparkware Are you asking how they get the same address on all chains?


[10/24/2022 02:10] 100proof
If so, then it's because you use the EVM `CREATE2` opcode to deploy them.


[10/24/2022 02:11] 100proof
I think it's only the same source code on all the chains. Each contract instance has separate data still.


[10/24/2022 02:13] acc01ade
You can DM me @acc01ade or one of our other devs @angello-dev @alexander


[10/24/2022 02:19] acc01ade
Any standards compliant contract can be deployed cross-chain. The HolographERC20 and HolographERC721 are the first standards enforcers in the protocol. They exist in a stack that is higher that the deployed custom code, they make sure standards are followed and enforced. Underlying custom code can be written to act however it needs to. Some simple samples of custom code are shown in the `contracts/token` dir. The protocol is built to be modular. Over time, new standards will be supported/added. ERC1155 is a perfect example of next standard being added. A user/dev can deploy contracts by creating a config, which primarily requires to specify which standard/type the contract will be following.

[10/24/2022 02:24] acc01ade
The deployed holographable contract is a stack of contracts actually. Holographer, enforcer (ERC20, ERC721, etc.), PA1D (if ERC721), and custom contract (samples: SampleERC20, SampleERC721, and CxipERC721). Function calls are routed through Holographer, which then forwards calls to enforcers, which eventually forward the calls to custom contract logic. The goal of enforcers is to do all the validation, security, and standards logic. The goal of custom contracts is to build all other logic (tokenURI for ERC721 for example).

{Reactions}
🔥 

[10/24/2022 13:02] acc01ade
Good point. We kind of assumed everyone knew what’s going on there 😬
That lzEndpoint.send call is where the message leaves our protocol and is handled by LayerZero until it enters in LayerZeroModule.lzReceive call on the destination chain back into our protocol.

The logic is in this function -->> https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-holograph/blob/main/hardhat.config.ts#L22
Modify the code to be like this: ```
const getEnvironment = (): Environment => {
  let environment = Environment.experimental;
  const acceptableBranches: Set<string> = new Set<string>(['experimental', 'develop', 'testnet', 'mainnet']);
  const env: string = process.env.HOLOGRAPH_ENVIRONMENT || '';
  if (acceptableBranches.has(env)) {
    console.log('HOLOGRAPH_ENVIRONMENT:', env);
    environment = Environment[env as keyof typeof Environment];
  }
  console.log('Environment:', environment);

  return environment;
};
```
Now it will only check for env var `$HOLOGRAPH_ENVIRONMENT` that can be used to overwrite it from `experimental` to something else.

Hello,one confusion on award distribution


[11/30/2022 01:15] .satyam_
Yesterday staff has provided a GitHub for the awards distribution,my name is mentioned 2 times over their..
But yet on this award announcements only one award is mentioned

Why it is so??


[11/30/2022 01:19] .satyam_
As from yesterday GitHub i calculated my total reward should be 54.28.something but here the total reward is not calculated only single award is been showed here


[11/30/2022 01:24] bit.surfer
its two different contest, you can check it again, the first field is id of contest


[11/30/2022 01:29] .satyam_
Is the Id 170 and 173?


[11/30/2022 01:31] .satyam_
I did not understand 🙃if any one here clear my doubt regarding id?


[11/30/2022 01:32] mukund_rana
id 173 is the id of holograph and id 170 was 3xcalibur i guess


[11/30/2022 01:32] bit.surfer
yes that's the contest id


[11/30/2022 01:34] .satyam_
Since 3xcalibur rewards have distributed than what's the logic of mentioning again?


[11/30/2022 01:35] TurnipBoy#5973
It wasn't mentioned again. The green lines where the ones added


[11/30/2022 01:35] mukund_rana
its not mentioned it is  a pull request to add award of id 170 in the list of all award from 1 to latest contests

thanks!


[11/30/2022 19:29] road220
please, someone from c4 team, what should I do?


[11/30/2022 20:01] road220
@acc01ade , it seems that judges missed my submission which we talked about and rewards also have been sent out, there is nothing to do about it, thanks C4!


[11/30/2022 21:06] cloudellie
Your issue was downgraded to QA and grouped with your QA report


[11/30/2022 21:08] cloudellie
If you wish to discuss further with the judge, you can make a request when the findings repo is made public. But the judges have final say and cannot provide a detailed explanation of every decision to each warden who competes in a contest.


[11/30/2022 21:09] cloudellie
Next time, if you have a question about a contest's outcome, please submit a help desk request and C4 staff will respond as we are able.


[11/30/2022 21:44] road220
i'll verify that, since it's too strange. Thanks a lot!
PS... Sorry, I have a horrible day(losing seed phrase, cuz my OS crashed for unknown reasons + something weird with current finding)

How come this is a medium issue and not a QA?


[12/17/2022 19:21] ladboy233
It is because in this context, there are application monitoring and listening to the event emission for approval?


[12/19/2022 06:57] teawaterwire
is there a way to check the calculations of the award for transparency's sake? i completely trust C4 - but cannot wrap my head around why some of us finding a Medium vuln get only <$1 🤔


[12/19/2022 07:14] bulej93
duplicates


[12/19/2022 07:38] teawaterwire
i understand that, but still would be helpful to see "total number of shares" - i guess there must be a spreadsheet somewhere 🙂


[12/19/2022 07:39] teawaterwire
maybe i'm the only one - but being able to verify (and not trust) would be great


[12/19/2022 07:42] bulej93

75k contest with 8 High and 19 Med findings with 147 wardens submitting accepted findings
Your finding M-06 was split between 10... Rough, but unfortunately how it works

[12/19/2022 08:45] teawaterwire
thanks for pointing this out 🙌 
but the maths still don't make sense to me (not just for my case, i looked at other wardens) 
following https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards
if there's 10 wardens on one med then the share formula is 
`3 * (0.9 ^ (10 - 1)) / 10` = `0,1162261467` 

not the 0.00302 given in your screenshot

what am i getting wrong? or the formula changed?

This contest is one of 4 contests which were using 0.6 as the exponent, not 0.9

[12/19/2022 09:05] teawaterwire
wow ok that explains everything now! the 0.6 exponent is brutal


[12/19/2022 14:56] pheonix244001
awards distributed ?


[12/21/2022 00:25] rotcivegaf
Can the judge answer this question?


[12/21/2022 00:28] ladboy233
😢


[12/21/2022 00:28] ladboy233
it is finalized anyway


[12/21/2022 00:28] ladboy233
can learn from trust and 0x52 finding


[12/21/2022 01:48] rotcivegaf
but it is part of learning, I need to know why it is valid as a means
for example report this https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-redactedcartel-findings/issues/334
and it was demoted to qa, I think it's quite similar to this issue


[12/21/2022 01:48] rotcivegaf
This also helps to not report false med/high
